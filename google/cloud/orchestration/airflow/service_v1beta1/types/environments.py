        environment (google.cloud.orchestration.airflow.service_v1beta1.types.Environment):
            A patch environment. Fields specified by the ``updateMask``
            will be copied from the patch environment into the
            environment under update.
        update_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to
            ``Environment``, of fields to update. For example, to set
            the version of scikit-learn to install in the environment to
            0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of argparse,
            the ``updateMask`` parameter would include the following two
            ``paths`` values:
            "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and
            "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.argparse". The included
            patch environment would specify the scikit-learn version as
            follows:

            ::

                {
                  "config":{
                    "softwareConfig":{
                      "pypiPackages":{
                        "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0"
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }

            Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages
            other than scikit-learn and argparse will be unaffected.

            Only one update type may be included in a single request's
            ``updateMask``. For example, one cannot update both the PyPI
            packages and labels in the same request. However, it is
            possible to update multiple members of a map field
            simultaneously in the same request. For example, to set the
            labels "label1" and "label2" while clearing "label3"
            (assuming it already exists), one can provide the paths
            "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and "labels.label3" and
            populate the patch environment as follows:

            ::

                {
                  "labels":{
                    "label1":"new-label1-value"
                    "label2":"new-label2-value"
                  }
                }

            Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are
            not included in the ``updateMask`` will be unaffected.

            It is also possible to replace an entire map field by
            providing the map field's path in the ``updateMask``. The
            new value of the field will be that which is provided in the
            patch environment. For example, to delete all pre-existing
            user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version
            1.7.14, the ``updateMask`` would contain the path
            "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and the patch
            environment would be the following:

            ::

                {
                  "config":{
                    "softwareConfig":{
                      "pypiPackages":{
                        "botocore":"==1.7.14"
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }

            **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages``

               -  Replace all custom custom PyPI packages. If a
                  replacement package map is not included in
                  ``environment``, all custom PyPI packages are cleared.
                  It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask
                  specifying an individual package.

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.``\ packagename

               -  Update the custom PyPI package *packagename*,
                  preserving other packages. To delete the package,
                  include it in ``updateMask``, and omit the mapping for
                  it in
                  ``environment.config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages``. It
                  is an error to provide both a mask of this form and
                  the ``config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`` mask.

            -  ``labels``

               -  Replace all environment labels. If a replacement
                  labels map is not included in ``environment``, all
                  labels are cleared. It is an error to provide both
                  this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual
                  labels.

            -  ``labels.``\ labelName

               -  Set the label named *labelName*, while preserving
                  other labels. To delete the label, include it in
                  ``updateMask`` and omit its mapping in
                  ``environment.labels``. It is an error to provide both
                  a mask of this form and the ``labels`` mask.

            -  ``config.nodeCount``

               -  Horizontally scale the number of nodes in the
                  environment. An integer greater than or equal to 3
                  must be provided in the ``config.nodeCount`` field. \*
                  ``config.webServerNetworkAccessControl``
               -  Replace the environment's current
                  WebServerNetworkAccessControl.

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides``

               -  Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides. If a
                  replacement config overrides map is not included in
                  ``environment``, all config overrides are cleared. It
                  is an error to provide both this mask and a mask
                  specifying one or more individual config overrides.

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.``\ section-name

               -  Override the Apache Airflow config property *name* in
                  the section named *section*, preserving other
                  properties. To delete the property override, include
                  it in ``updateMask`` and omit its mapping in
                  ``environment.config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides``.
                  It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and
                  the ``config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides``
                  mask.

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.envVariables``

               -  Replace all environment variables. If a replacement
                  environment variable map is not included in
                  ``environment``, all custom environment variables are
                  cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask and
                  a mask specifying one or more individual environment
                  variables.

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.imageVersion``

               -  Upgrade the version of the environment in-place. Refer
                  to ``SoftwareConfig.image_version`` for information on
                  how to format the new image version. Additionally, the
                  new image version cannot effect a version downgrade
                  and must match the current image version's Composer
                  major version and Airflow major and minor versions.
                  Consult the `Cloud Composer Version
                  List <https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions>`__
                  for valid values.

            -  ``config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount``

               -  Horizontally scale the number of schedulers in
                  Airflow. A positive integer not greater than the
                  number of nodes must be provided in the
                  ``config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount`` field. \*
                  ``config.databaseConfig.machineType``
               -  Cloud SQL machine type used by Airflow database. It
                  has to be one of: db-n1-standard-2, db-n1-standard-4,
                  db-n1-standard-8 or db-n1-standard-16. \*

               -  Machine type on which Airflow web server is running.
                  It has to be one of: composer-n1-webserver-2,
                  composer-n1-webserver-4 or composer-n1-webserver-8. \*
                  ``config.maintenanceWindow``

                  components may be under maintenance.

            When used as input, the server also checks if the provided
            version is supported and denies the request for an
            unsupported version.

            The Cloud Composer portion of the version is a `semantic
